## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I was inetersted in the process of creating a chat app, although react-chat-engine has alot of functionality built in I was still able to destructure certain parts of the app and rebuild and customize to my liking. I learned alot during the course of making this app including using Material-ui for size repsonsive styling, using .env and localStorage in react,  This has inspired me to get a deeper understanding of the mern stack and to keep learning through trying new projects and ideas.

## <a name="Install">Installation</a>
The deployed live app is [HERE](https://virus2.netlify.app/)

* To clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lroberts77/virus.git
$ cd virus
$ npm install
```

## <a name="Usage">Usage</a>
* Open a terminal
```shell
$ cd virus
$ npm start
```
If a tab doesn't open with the virus app running, open a new tab and type in http://localhost:3000 in the url bar and press enter.

I have created two test users test1 and test2, the username and passwords are the same eg. username test1, password test1. Enter one of the usernames at the login screen and submit to login. Once logged in you will see the messaging page with people on the right showing who is in the chat and if they are online denoted by a small green circl next to their avatar or red if they are offline. Type your message to chat and add photos if desired then sign out when you have finished chatting, hope you enjoy the app.
