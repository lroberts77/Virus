I have created two test users test1 and test2, the username and passwords are the same eg. username test1, password test1. Enter one of the usernames at the login screen and submit to login. Once logged in you will see the messaging page with people on the right showing who is in the chat and if they are online denoted by a small green circl next to their avatar or red if they are offline. Type your message to chat and add photos if desired then sign out when you have finished chatting, hope you enjoy the app.
